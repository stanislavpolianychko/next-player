# Podcast Player and Recorder

This project is a simple React Next TypeScript application that allows users to play podcast episodes and record audio. The podcast episodes are fetched from the provided RSS feed, and users can start playback with a single click and pause with a second click. Additionally, the application allows users to record audio, stop the recording, and provides a download link for the recorded file.
